# Alien Game Shop

**Alien Game Shop** is a captivating, atmospheric Unity experience where you explore a quirky alien store through a network of surveillance cameras. This project is a tiny window into a strange, lively world — more vibe and immersion than game.

## Why I Made This

Also born from Unity’s Creative Core course, I took the asset base and ran wild with it—building new animations, menus, soundscapes, code, and VFX to create what I believe is my most immersive project yet. The alien theme let me flex some sci-fi world-building muscle.
